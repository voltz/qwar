3.     Summary

Teach players about everything mentioned in tailored Quiz. Schools or companies can use this application to measure the knowledge of their students or employees.They even can use this application to measure the knowledge of public people about their products, services, etc.

For further development, we want to build admin module to be given to schools and companies so they can add their quizes and set quiz to public or invitation only. Each admin can create other admin account with certain access permissions.

For further development of the schools, can be used to carry out tests of the ability of their students and the school's admission test. The school can also carry out tests to provide scholarships with a value chosen from the implementation of the quiz.

For further development of the companies, can be used to carry out tests of the ability of their employees and also admission test companies such as psychological test and test capabilities in specific areas. The company could also use this quiz to improve the performance of every employee and can also be used for questionnaires such as the assessment of a product on a general public

We also will create category/folder for quizes so players can find the related quiz easily in further development, as well as the title. Items to increase the stats or change the attack animation and more skills can also be developed later.

Chat feature can be useful too, especially when waiting the decision who will be attacked.
